Up to now:
1. install and run clickhouse
2. run ontime test example on data from year 1987 and 1988, around 1 mil data points.

Plan:
1. read source code of clickhouse. Understanding the whole process from parser, interpreter to llvm, etc.
direction: i). find short blogs on postgres source code which helps to analyse the implementation of database in general. ii). find some reference on 
database theory, but clickhouse is OLAP database, which is vastly different from traditional OLTP database, so it might not help too much to dive into 
traditional database implementation. Advice is to read source code of clickhouse directly.
2. try build clickhouse from source.
3.Postgres source code reading,
4. neo4j (graph database?)
5. Impala (distributed database, for optimization).
6. run other OLTP benchmark like tpcds and tpch to see what advantage clickhouse has and dig into code from there (medium priority)
